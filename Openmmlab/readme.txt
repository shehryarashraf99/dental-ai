this folder contains code necessary to convert annotations into the correct format so that i can do semantic segmentation
using pretrained models found in openmmlab. an example of an image and its segmentation map is present, as proof

I also have here code used to run a pretrained model on my custom dataset using mmdetection in the mmdetection.ipynb file
