This project, I worked on a couple of years, some of the code is uploaded here  to demonstrate my coding capabilities in python
Alot of the code is messy, because I was working on  a short deadline, to get enough accuracy to demonstrate viability of the whole dental-ai project.
Three main dental tasks were done, tooth numbering, dental diagnosis and bone loss measurement.
 I used mask rcnn as implemented by Matterport, as the model, and modified it to take in our custom dataset and tuned hyperparameters to get the best result
I tire of coding tests for every position i apply to, much simpler to simply upload stuff on github instead
