our aim is to measure boneloss in bitewing images

we use a pose model for this, so we need some points as well as some bounding boxes

points and bounding boxes annotations are done for same images, but different datasets so here is code to extract points and bounding boxes
and reformat into yolo format as we need to use a yolo pose model
